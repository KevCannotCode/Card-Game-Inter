# Card-Game-Inter
This project is a card game called Inter. The rules of this game can be found in the Rules section bellow.

**rules**
This covers most of the rules of the game, lmk if you have questions. I think I’ll just do a demo to make it clearer. 
BASIC REQUIREMENT
•	52 cards
•	Minimum 2 players and up to as many as you can
PLAYING:
•	Each player receives 5 cards from the deck, and they play one after another. The goal is to be the first to get rid of all cards in hand. The first player who has no remaining card in his hand wins.
•	At start, there will be one card on the pile. Then, players would each put a card on the pile at their turn. You can only put a card on the pile if it either has the same suit or rank as the card on the top of the pile. 
•	A player can play multiple cards at once only if they have the same rank and match the card on the pile.  
•	If a player does not have a card that matches the rank or the suit in the pile, he will have to draw a card from the deck. If the drawn card still doesn’t match the card in the pile, the player simply passes his turn to the next player.
•	If the previous player plays a joker, the next player can play any card he wishes. 
•	Penalizing cards will make the next players draw some cards, skip their turn, or inquire for a specific card from other players.
PENALIZING CARDS:
•	The penalizing cards are ace, two, eight, ten, and joker. If a player plays one of those cards it will penalize the player who plays right after him. For example: if one player plays an Ace it will skip the turn of the next player. 
•	A player can play multiple penalizing cards that have the same rank. If there are only 2 players, the opponent will be affected by all penalty cards. If there are more than two players, each card will be distributed to each player. The penalty cards cannot affect the player who played them. For example: in a game of 3 players, if the first player plays 3 aces, the 3 aces will be distributed to the other players. The next 2 players will skip their turn. Since the player who played the aces cannot be affected, the turn of the player after him will skip his turn again.
•	Playing a 2 will make the next player draw 2 cards from the deck and skip his turn. You penalize multiple players if you play multiple 2’s. For example, in a game of 4 players, if you play 2 two’s, the next 2 players after you will have to draw 2 cards each and skip their turns. 
•	An Ace will skip the turn of the next player. Playing multiple aces will skip many players’ turns if there are more than 2 players. If a player plays x number of aces, then x players that come after him will not play. if there are only 2 players, then the opponent’s turn is only skipped once regardless of the number of aces that are played at once.  
•	Likewise, playing a ten will make the next players draw 4 cards from the deck and skip their turn. 
•	Playing a joker will make other players draw 5 cards and skip their turns. 
SPECIAL CARDS:
•	If a player plays one or more 7’s, they should always be accompanied by another card that has the same suit. If the player does not have a card to accompany the 7, he should put the 7 on the pile and pick a card from the deck to accompany the 7. 
•	If a player plays an eight, he must ask other players to play a card of his choice. The player must ask for a card that he has in his hand. If the next player doesn’t have the card inquired, he should pick a card from the deck. If that card isn’t the inquired card, he passes his turn. This goes on until a player finds the card that was asked or until the turn reaches the player who played the eight.
